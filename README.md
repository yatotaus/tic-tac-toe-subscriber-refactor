# Tic Tac Toe Subscriber Refactor

There are three different branches to take a look at ðŸ‘€ Read below the differences between each one of them. 


## Vanilla Refactor 
this is the closest representation of the original project using vanilla JS and css. Then refactor the Tic Tac Toe game to use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. 

## TypeScript Refactor 
You can also view the typescript Git branch to see how this would look written in TS rather than JS.

## React Refactor + TypeScript
this shows a React implementation of the project, which is a much more declarative approach than the vanilla implementations, which are mostly imperative.
